repurchase framework under the previously approved\nrepurchase program of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 43% were still available for\nrepurchase at June 30, 2024.In light of

PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

assets.Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight.Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights\nthan other types of exposures.PNC elected a five-year transition provision effective March 31, 2020 to delay until December 31, 2021 the full impact of the CECL\nstandard on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period.Effective for the first quarter 2022, PNC is now in the three-\nyear

Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions\nwill be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential\nlegal and regulatory contingencies.These statements are based on our views that:\n– Job and income gains will continue to support consumer spending growth this year, but PNC’s baseline\nforecast is for slower economic growth in 2024 as higher interest rates remain a drag on the economy.– Real GDP growth this year will be close to trend at around 2%, and the unemployment rate will increase\nmodestly to somewhat above 4% by the end of 2024.Inflation will continue to slow as wage pressures\nabate, gradually moving back to the Federal Reserve’s 2% long-term objective.– With slowing inflation PNC expects two federal funds rate cuts of 25 basis points each at the Federal\nOpen Market Committee’s September and December meetings, with the rate ending this year in a range\nbetween 4.75% and 5.00%.PNC expects multiple federal funds rate cuts in 2025 as inflation continues\nto ease.▪ PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to PNC\nmeeting or exceeding minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer established by the Federal\nReserve Board in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s

using the applicable annualized interest income or interest expense divided by the applicable average earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities.Net interest margin is the total yield on

margins, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields used in the calculation\nof net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt

and Capital Planning.PNC and PNC Bank are subject to the regulatory capital\nrequirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively.The foundation of the agencies’ regulatory capital rules is\nthe international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee, the international body responsible for developing\nglobal regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions.The regulatory capital\nrules establish minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, referred to\nas risk-based capital requirements, as well as for the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and other exposures, referred\nto as leverage capital requirements.The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone significant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel Committee’s international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel III”, as\nwell as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank.On July 27, 2023, and as described in more detail below, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and\nFDIC proposed for public comment an interagency rule to implement the final components of the Basel III framework that would\nsignificantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank.The federal banking agencies currently tailor the application of their capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential requirements for\nbanking organizations to the asset size and risk profile (as measured by certain regulatory metrics)of the banking organization.The\nagencies’ capital and liquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or more in total assets into one of four categories (Category I,\nCategory II, Category III and Category IV), with the most stringent capital and liquidity requirements applying to Category I firms and\nthe least restrictive requirements applying to Category IV firms.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"+ifr4GiiNp/iZLIG4WGmbtLU+abBzykESYshgOAjeK4="},"694231c4-d7ff-4639-bb6a-7544ff2e6ddf":{"id_":"694231c4-d7ff-4639-bb6a-7544ff2e6ddf","metadata":{"page_number":9,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

The statement explains that the federal banking agencies will continue to exercise\ndiscretion to not take enforcement action against either a fund complex that is a principal shareholder of a bank, or a bank for which a\nfund complex is a principal shareholder, with respect to extensions of credit by the bank to the related interests of such fund complex\nthat otherwise would violate the insider lending restrictions, subject to certain conditions.\nThe Federal Reserve is required to establish standards under the statutory provision known as the “Durbin Amendment” for assessing\nwhether the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer such as PNC Bank is reasonable and proportional to the cost\nincurred by the issuer, subject to certain adjustments. The Federal Reserve implemented these standards through Regulation II, which\nlimits the interchange fee an issuer may charge based on three components. On October 25, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed\nrevisions to the three components of the interchange fee cap. We expect the proposed rule, if finalized in its current form, would\nreduce PNC Bank’s interchange fee revenue.\nThe Federal Reserve and the OCC have provided guidance regarding incentive and other elements of compensation provided to\nexecutives and other employees at banking organizations they regulate, both as general industry-wide guidance and guidance specific\nto select larger companies, including PNC. These guidelines are intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of\ncovered banking organizations do not encourage excessive risk-taking.

increase the cost of FDIC deposit insurance premiums to an insured bank as FDIC deposit insurance premiums are “risk\nbased.” Therefore, higher fee percentages would be charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles.These risk\nprofiles take into account, among other things, weaknesses that are found by the primary federal banking regulator through its\nexamination and supervision of the bank and the bank’s holdings of assets or liabilities classified as higher risk by the FDIC, including\nbrokered deposits.A negative evaluation by the FDIC or a bank’s primary federal banking regulator could increase the costs to a bank\nand result in an aggregate cost of deposit funds higher than that of competing banks in a lower risk category.Following the bank failures in March 2023, the FDIC invoked the systemic risk exception to certain resolution-related and Deposit\nInsurance Fund restrictions in order to fully protect all depositors of the affected

into our investment and\nportfolio management practices, and helping clients finance their own sustainability goals. These tenets have been incorporated into\nour Climate Action Strategy that was formalized at the start of 2022 to enable us to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nOur approach will be iterative and flexible, highlighting five main areas: employee engagement; long-term collaboration with\nstakeholders, external partners and industry groups; support for our customers’ transition plans; executing on our own operational\nsustainability goals; and portfolio alignment over time, emphasizing climate risk identification and management, and financed\nemissions calculations as initial work sets.\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to ensure an appropriate balancing of environmental considerations with other organizational\npriorities as we pursue our purpose of helping all of our stakeholders move forward financially.

PNC’s Climate Risk Committee specifically oversees the integration of climate-related risks\ninto the ERM Framework.\nWe assess climate change risks under two distinct categories: transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are experienced as the\nworld moves toward a low-carbon economy and becomes less reliant upon fossil fuels. They can be reputational in nature or driven by\nchanges in the market, technology and/or policy. Because transition risks are typically experienced to a greater degree in the short- to\nmedium-term, they are dependent upon near-term policy decisions.

1A – RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.As a\nfinancial services company, certain elements of risk are inherent in what we do and the business decisions we make.Thus, we\nencounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.For\nmore information about how we manage risks, see the Risk Management section of this Report.The following are the material risk factors that affect us of which we are currently aware.Any one or more of these risk factors could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In addition, these risks present\nother possible adverse consequences, including those described below.These risk factors and other risks we face are also discussed\nfurther in other sections of this Report.Thus, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we\nmay face.Risks Related to the Economy and Other External Factors, Including Regulation\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions.Given the nature of our business, our business and overall financial performance are affected to a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S.Declining or adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in investor, consumer and business\nsentiment generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services or reduce the\nnumber of creditworthy borrowers.The ability of borrowers to repay loans is often weakened as a result of economic downturns,\nhigher inflation and unemployment.This may be further exacerbated by a deterioration in households’ finances, particularly if\nconsumers also continue to face high inflation.In addition, adverse economic conditions, including periods of inflation, may limit the\navailability of, or increase the costs of, capital and labor, erode consumer and customer purchasing power, confidence and spending\nand may also reduce our tolerance for extending credit.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"sjzwrFLf8mRGlv9zshhd5c+tnQ/OYE5nhMgv/ixN2UM="},"d72406a8-0cff-48ce-9236-e62fed63c260":{"id_":"d72406a8-0cff-48ce-9236-e62fed63c260","metadata":{"page_number":22,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

automation that leverage AI/machine learning algorithms.These models can be more predictive, but because of the\ncomplex way in which the many variables in AI/machine learning models interact, the results of these models are often less\ninterpretable than traditional statistical models.Examples of model uses include determining the pricing of various products,\nidentifying potentially

assessing capital adequacy.We depend\nsignificantly on models for credit loss accounting under CECL, capital stress testing and estimating the value of items in our financial\nstatements.Models generally predict or infer certain financial outcomes, leveraging historical data and assumptions as to the future, often with\nrespect to macroeconomic conditions.Development and implementation of some of these models, such as the models for credit loss\naccounting under CECL, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments.Other models are used to support decisions\nmade regarding how we do business with customers.Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business\ndecisions based on information incorporating model output will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information.For\nexample, our models may not be effective if historical data does not accurately represent future events or environments or if our\nmodels rely on erroneous data, formulas, algorithms or assumptions and our internal model review processes fail to detect and address\nthese flaws.Models, if flawed, could cause information we provide to the

parent company and regulatory capital\nlimitations).PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with\nits SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process as described in the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report.Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess\nof the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase\nprogram of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 45% were still available for repurchase at December 31, 2023.In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework,

starting in the late spring or early summer; this will support economic\ngrowth in the second half of 2024.• GDP growth this year will be below trend at slightly above 1%, and the unemployment rate

Average consumer loans increased driven by higher\nresidential real estate and home equity loans as a result of new volume and draws on existing accounts outpacing liquidations, as well\nas growth in credit card loans due to new account production and purchase volume increases. The increase was partially offset by\ndeclines across the remaining portfolio as paydowns outpaced new originations. Average commercial loans increased due to growth in\nautomobile dealer segment balances, partially offset by forgiveness of PPP loans.\nOur focus on growing primary customer relationships is at the core of our deposit strategy in Retail, which is based on attracting and\nretaining stable, low-cost deposits as a key funding source for PNC. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing, focused on\nretaining relationship-based balances and executing on targeted deposit growth and retention strategies aimed at more rate-sensitive\ncustomers. Our goal with regard to deposits is to optimize balances, economics and long-term customer growth. In 2023, average total\ndeposits decreased compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of increased consumer spending and quantitative tightening by the Federal\nReserve.\nAs part of our strategic focus on growing customers and meeting their financial needs, we operate and continue to optimize a coast-to-\ncoast network of retail branches, solution centers and ATMs, which are complemented by PNC’s suite of digital capabilities.

Culture\nA strong risk culture helps us make well informed decisions, helps ensure individuals conform to the established culture, reduces an\nindividual’s ability to do something for personal gain, and rewards employees for working toward a common goal rather than\nindividual interests.Our risk culture reinforces the appropriate protocols for responsible and ethical behavior.These protocols are\nespecially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.Managing risk is every employee’s responsibility.All of our employees, individually and collectively, are responsible for ensuring the\norganization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated\nobjectives.All employees are also responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and\nhow risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities.Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to\nidentify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required.We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance\nmanagement system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.Proactive and open communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of\nrisk issues.Our multi-level risk committee structure provides formal channels to identify and report risk.Enterprise Strategy\nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing processes.These components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors\nor one of its committees.Risk Appetite: Our risk appetite represents the organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and\nliquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans.The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively\ndescribes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies.Qualitative guiding\nprinciples further define each of the risks within our taxonomy to support the risk appetite statement.Risk appetite metrics and\nlimits, including forward-looking metrics, quantitatively measure whether we are operating within our stated Risk

is responsible for establishing\nthe risk governance framework and the standards within each independent risk area for identifying, measuring, monitoring,\ncontrolling and reporting aggregate risks.As the second line of defense, the independent risk areas monitor the risks generated by\nthe first line of defense, review and challenge the implementation of effective risk management practices, perform independent\nassessment of risk, and report on issues or exceptions.The risk areas help to ensure processes and controls owned by the\nbusinesses are designed and operating as intended.Third

and negative)in the level of credit risk\nat both the borrower and portfolio level.To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of\nthe borrower’s PD and LGD for each related credit facility.This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity\nin the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes.In addition to\nmonitoring the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geographies\nthat may exist in our portfolio.Our commercial and industrial portfolio is well-diversified across industries as shown in the following\ntable (based on the North American Industry Classification System).Table 16:

of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets.See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of December 31,\n2023.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD and the remaining estimated\ncontractual term for a loan, loan segment or lease.We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated\ncontractual term in our expected loss estimates.We use historical data, current borrower characteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease.PDs represent a quantification of\nrisk of the likelihood that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time.LGD describes\nthe estimated magnitude of potential loss if a borrower were to default, and EAD (or utilization rates for certain revolving loans)is the\nestimated balance outstanding at the expected time of default.These parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the\nlong-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights.Prior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted cash flow methodology for our consumer real estate related loan classes and certain\nTDRs.Effective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our use of the discounted cash flow methodology, and we now use a pooled\nexpected credit loss methodology as described above.For loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans, we establish individually assessed reserves using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP.Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans exceeding a defined dollar threshold are\nbased on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s

components.The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements\nat a reasonable cost.The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable.We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company and all subsidiaries combined)to help\nensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.To ensure a strong liquidity\nposition and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid\nunencumbered securities.Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific,\nliquidity stress event.In addition, management performs a set of internal liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying\nlevels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event.In the most severe liquidity\nstress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure.The\nsimulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding,\naccelerated runoff of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations.Parent\ncompany stress coverage limits and operating liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

limits.PNC was in compliance with all relevant internal and regulatory liquidity limits and guidelines during 2023.One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure\nthat covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical\n30-day stress scenario.PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%.The\nLCR for both PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the regulatory minimum requirement throughout the year for 2023, 2022 and 2021.Fluctuations in our average LCR result from changes to the components of the calculation, including high-quality liquid assets and net\ncash outflows, as a result of ongoing business activity.The NSFR is designed to measure the stability of the maturity structure of assets and liabilities of banking organizations over a one-\nyear time horizon.PNC and PNC Bank calculate the NSFR daily and are required to maintain a regulatory minimum of 100%.PNC\nand PNC Bank have maintained NSFR compliance since the metric became effective on July 1, 2021.We

Factors\nand Note 19 Regulatory Matters.Market Risk Management\nMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit\nspreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in\nthe following activities, among others:\n• Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,\n• Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities, securities underwriting\nand our investment portfolio, and\n• Other investments, including equity, and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors.We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk.Market Risk\nManagement provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in\nthe business to management committees and, where appropriate, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans.Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources.Due\nto the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only\naffect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk\nmanagement policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"lO8nkeC+XsWCUUkJ4d8WWcmeVZRq+6Tff3JxBpP8E7Q="},"f917926f-c042-4577-9c8a-37e0de1c7e25":{"id_":"f917926f-c042-4577-9c8a-37e0de1c7e25","metadata":{"page_number":81,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

point instantaneous increase or decrease is not materially different from the 200 basis point scenarios as disclosed above.When forecasting net interest income, we make certain key assumptions that can materially impact the resulting sensitivities, including\nthe following:\nFuture Balance Sheet Composition: Our balance sheet composition is dynamic and based on our forecasted expectations.As of the\nfourth quarter 2023, the projected balance sheet composition by the end of year one is generally consistent with the spot composition\nas of the fourth quarter 2023.Deposit Betas: Deposit pricing changes are primarily driven by changes in the Federal Funds rate, with the relationship between\ndeposit rates and Federal Funds rate defined as deposit beta.We define cumulative deposit beta as the change in deposit rate paid on\ninterest bearing non-maturity deposits divided by the change in the upper level of the stated Federal Funds rate range since the first\nquarter of 2022, the start of the current rising rate cycle.As of December 2023, PNC’s cumulative deposit beta was 44%, an increase\nfrom 31% at December 2022.For interest rate risk modeling, PNC uses dynamic beta models to adjust assumed repricing sensitivity\ndepending on market rate levels as well as other factors.The dynamic beta assumptions reflect historical experience and future\nexpectations.Our scenario assumes that deposit betas slightly increase from current levels.Actual deposit rate paid may differ from\nmodeled projections due to variables such as competition for deposits and customer

Prepayments: PNC includes prepayment assumptions for both loan and investment portfolios.Mortgage and Home Equity\nportfolios utilize an industry standard model to drive estimated prepayments that increase in lower rate environments.Commercial and\nconsumer loan portfolios assume static constant prepayment rates that are consistent across rate scenarios, as those portfolios\nhistorically do not exhibit significantly different prepayment behaviors based upon the level of market rates.Impact of Derivatives: PNC uses interest rate derivatives to hedge floating rate commercial loans.PNC had $33.3 billion in receive\nfix / pay float swaps as of December 31, 2023, with a weighted average duration of 2.3 years and an average fixed rate of 2.1%.As of\nDecember 31, 2023 PNC also had collars in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge\nthese commercial loans.Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt.See Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans and fixed rate debt.EVE sensitivity results for the fourth quarter of

calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of\nassets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.Similar to\nthe NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"JY1d71R3RV7f54OZzrbpNfQ2DaEJQ7HkxOqdNlYb/qk="},"fb7f94bf-9f17-4b5f-92db-32ac6aeb0cc1":{"id_":"fb7f94bf-9f17-4b5f-92db-32ac6aeb0cc1","metadata":{"page_number":82,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging\nactivities.These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are\nmarked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities.We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities.VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors.A diversified VaR reflects empirical\ncorrelations across different asset classes.We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2023 and\n2022 were within our acceptable limits.To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting.The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day.Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability.Actual observations include customer-related revenue and intraday hedging, which helps to\nreduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day VaR measure.There were no instances during\n2023 and 2022 under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior-day VaR measure.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"/zEFvUQ5pIEsE0iTydDvVCMq/S3Qw6iqhK5f236yTcU="},"8293b4d7-1fcc-4b89-829c-8257bf84fa2f":{"id_":"8293b4d7-1fcc-4b89-829c-8257bf84fa2f","metadata":{"page_number":82,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

impact affecting certain fixed costs or expenses, an erosion of consumer and customer purchasing power,\nand fluctuations in the need or demand for our products and services.When significant levels of inflation occur, our business could\npotentially be impacted by, among other things, reducing our tolerance for extending credit or causing us to incur additional credit\nlosses resulting from possible increased default rates.Throughout 2023, the Federal Reserve monetary policy has tightened with the\nintent to slow inflation, which has led to larger increases in interest rates.See Risk Factors in Item 1A, our Executive Summary and\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking statements in this Item 7 for further discussion of inflation and its overall impact to\nthe economy, our

reported to management and the Risk Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.Strong operational risk management and well-informed risk-based decisions benefit us by improving the\ncustomer experience, enhancing compliance, reducing reputational risk, minimizing losses and establishing an appropriate amount of\nrequired operational risk capital held by us.The Operational Risk Management Framework is designed to provide effective and consistent management of operational risk.The\nprimary purpose of the framework is to enable us to understand our operational risks and manage them to the desired risk profile, in\nline with our Risk Appetite.Additionally, the guidance established within the framework assists management in making well-informed\nrisk-based business decisions.The framework provides a disciplined and structured process for us to manage operational risk across eight operational risk domains.These domains provide a comprehensive view of operational risk and allow us to discuss operational risk in a standard way,\nfacilitating reporting and ongoing risk mitigation.The operational risk domains are:\n• Operations: Risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, misconduct or errors of people or fraud.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"TM8/QAMgiwCiMYD9QuBRPPgZ/IiAQfWVeu8cD/mSSOQ="},"8d8d0e21-d408-49c2-800d-99352a656030":{"id_":"8d8d0e21-d408-49c2-800d-99352a656030","metadata":{"page_number":84,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

or pooled reserves, (ii)individually assessed reserves, and\n(iii)qualitative (judgmental)reserves.Our methodologies and key assumptions for each of these components are discussed in Note 1\nAccounting Policies.Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast\nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios\nwith associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes.Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to\nthem.To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment.Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight)to represent our current expectation within\nthat distribution over the forecast period.This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC.This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets.Each\nquarter, the scenarios are presented to RAC for approval, and the committee also approves CECL scenario weights for use during the\ncurrent reporting period.The scenarios used for the period ended December 31, 2023 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the\ncorresponding tightening of monetary policy and credit availability.We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.unemployment rate.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"gSqQ5G4U9gmrYi4XoxnjAxP2GyMU2xH+1vvJhUKHAjM="},"d2229de0-26e2-4a5f-ae0d-ec7fd6b2924a":{"id_":"d2229de0-26e2-4a5f-ae0d-ec7fd6b2924a","metadata":{"page_number":86,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses – Commercial Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loans and lease losses was approximately\n$4,791 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $3,259 million relates to commercial loans.For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and other relevant factors.As disclosed by management, the Company\nconsiders reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses and has established a framework which includes\nthe use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period.To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, the Company uses a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking judgment to forecast\nthe distribution of economic outcomes.Management used a number of economic variables in the scenarios, which are inputs into the\nloss forecasting models, with the most significant drivers being Real GDP and U.S.unemployment rate.Also included in the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the\nCompany’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions.For example,\nqualitative factors may include industry concentration and conditions, changes in market conditions, changes in the nature and volume\nof the Company’s portfolio, recent credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular portfolios, recent

estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial\nstatements.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity.Certain cash balances within Cash and due from banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as to\nwithdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.Investments\nWe hold interests in various types of investments.The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including,\nbut not limited to, items such as:\n• Ownership interest,\n• Our plans for the investment, and\n• The nature of the investment.Debt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.We classify debt securities as either trading, held to maturity or available for sale.Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading activities are classified as trading\nsecurities, are reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at fair value.For debt securities\nclassified as trading, realized and unrealized gains and losses within our Capital markets business are included in Capital markets and\nadvisory noninterest income; other realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Other noninterest income.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"4tpddZLKm4VptdXq/cD2AYS/kK4hhn1VEwWG3e99TKw="},"02c5500b-e0c7-4d8a-af42-ab5927b51b47":{"id_":"02c5500b-e0c7-4d8a-af42-ab5927b51b47","metadata":{"page_number":100,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

on the sale of available for sale debt securities on a specific security basis.These securities gains and losses are\nincluded in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.The CECL standard requires expected credit losses on both held to maturity and available for sale securities to be recognized through\na valuation allowance, ACL, instead of as a direct write-down to the amortized cost basis of the security.An available for sale security\nis considered impaired if the fair value is less than its amortized cost basis.If any portion of the decline in fair value is related to\ncredit, the amount of allowance is determined as the portion related to credit, limited to the difference between the amortized cost\nbasis and the fair value of the security.If we have the intent to sell, or believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell an\nimpaired available for sale security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the credit loss is recorded as a direct write-down of the\namortized cost basis.Credit losses on investment securities are recognized through the Provision for credit losses on our Consolidated\nIncome Statement.Declines in the

discussions that follow in this Note 1 for additional information about those\nadjustments.Discounted Cash Flow\nPrior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted cash flow methodology for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes, in\naddition to our TDR portfolios.We determined effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments.Changes in the ALLL due to the impact of the passage of time under the discounted cash flow estimate were recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.Effective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our use of a discounted cash flow methodology, and we now use a pooled expected loss\nmethodology based upon the quantification of risk parameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan segment.Individually Assessed Component\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows:\n• For commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, reserves are based on an analysis of\nthe present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for\ncollateral dependent loans.Nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold are reserved for under a pooled\nbasis, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics.• For consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts\npreviously charged off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.Qualitative Component\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors, the ACL also accounts for\nfactors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves.Such qualitative factors\nmay include, but are not limited to:\n• Industry concentrations and conditions,\n• Changes in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form 10-K

liability method.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws\nthat we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse.Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for\nin the period of enactment.Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in Income tax\nexpense.The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets.Realization refers to\nthe incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets,\nassuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future\ntaxable income.We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based\nupon all available positive and negative evidence.We have elected to apply the proportional amortization method to our qualifying LIHTC and NMTC equity

In doing so, we use several credit quality indicators, including trends in delinquency\nrates, nonperforming status, analysis of PD and LGD ratings, updated credit scores and originated and updated LTV ratios.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower, repayment sources, underlying collateral and other support given\ncurrent events, economic conditions and expectations. We refine our practices to meet the changing environment, such as inflation\nlevels, industry specific risks, interest rate levels, the level of consumer savings and deposit balances, and structural and secular\nchanges fostered by the pandemic.

estate and home equity loans at\nleast quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk\nin the loan classes.\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and subordinate lien positions): At least quarterly, we update the property values of real estate\ncollateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant\ndeclines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\nWe use a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (e.g., line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (i.e., if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider, HPI changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation models, broker price opinions, HPI indices, property location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of\nthe calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we refine our methodology.\n118 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form

with FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (collectively, the Agencies).FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through\nSPEs that they sponsor.As an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of VA insured loans into mortgage-\nbacked securities for sale into the secondary market.In Non-agency securitizations,

securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans or loss share arrangements under certain\nconditions, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary and/or

interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and\ndiscount rates.The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S.dollar interest rate swaps and are

over-the-counter markets.• Level 2: Fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or\nliabilities, either directly or indirectly.The majority of Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities and listed\nderivative contracts with quoted prices that are traded in markets that are not active, and certain debt

unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models and discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques for which the significant valuation inputs are not observable and the\ndetermination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.We characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information, with\nreasonably narrow bid/ask spreads, and where dealer quotes received do not vary widely and are based on current information.Inactive markets are typically characterized by low transaction volumes, price quotations that vary substantially among market\nparticipants or are not based on current information, wide bid/ask spreads, a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums,\nyields, or performance indicators for observed transactions or quoted prices compared to historical periods, a significant decline or\nabsence of a market for new issuance, or any combination of the above factors.We also consider nonperformance risks, including\ncredit risk, as part of our valuation methodology for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value, by their nature, result in a higher degree of financial statement

to review and independent testing as part of our\nmodel validation and internal control testing processes.Our Model Risk Management Group reviews significant models on at least an\nannual basis.In addition, the Valuation Committee approves valuation methodologies and reviews the results of independent valuation\nreviews and processes for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

fair value on a recurring basis.The election of the fair value\noption aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages with the related hedges.Residential mortgage loans are valued based on\nquoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments\nand bid information received from market participants.The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value\nin the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar\nloans.These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative\ninsensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans.Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage\nloans held for sale are classified as Level 2.Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nWe account for certain commercial mortgage loans classified as held for sale in whole loan transactions at fair value.We determine\nthe fair value of commercial mortgage loans held for sale based upon discounted cash flows.Fair value is determined using sale\nvaluation assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the loans.For loans to be sold to agencies with servicing retained, the fair value is adjusted for the estimated servicing cash flows, which is an\nunobservable input.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"j8TnzZ152OKcvUPordNVBAP8GqHFylhuN08AtIjQDJI="},"329950e1-8afe-4800-92cb-3a6960636a92":{"id_":"329950e1-8afe-4800-92cb-3a6960636a92","metadata":{"page_number":148,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based\non a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not\nrecorded on the balance sheet.The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments\nunder the derivative contract.The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index.Residential and\ncommercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.The following tables presents the notional

with the same counterparty upon the\noccurrence of an event of default.The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to\ncollateralize either party’s net position.Collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the\npositions with the counterparty as of the preceding day.Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future\nexposure, may also be required to be exchanged.In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is\nexchanged.Any cash collateral

to:\n• Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,\n• Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust\nand the Plan,\n• Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and\n• Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment\nreturn, at an appropriate level of risk.The Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of return on equities\nrelative to long term expectations, the named investment fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and\nother relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to\nparticipants and beneficiaries.Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility\nrequired by the dynamic allocation policy.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form 10-K

the level of liquidity\nand activity in the market for the security.Mutual funds • Valued based on third-party pricing of the fund that is not actively traded.Other investments\nDerivative financial instruments\nGroup annuity contracts\nPreferred stock\n• Derivative financial instruments - recorded at estimated fair value as determined by third-party appraisals\nand pricing models.• Group annuity contracts - measured at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current\nyields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the creditworthiness of the issuer.• Preferred stock - valued at the closing price reported on an active market on which the securities are traded.Investments measured at NAV\nCollective trust fund investments\nLimited partnerships\n• Collective trust fund investments - valued based upon the units of such collective trust fund held by the Plan\nat year end multiplied by the respective unit value.The unit value of the collective trust fund is based upon\nsignificant observable inputs, although it is not based upon quoted prices in an active market.The\nunderlying investments of the collective trust funds consist primarily of

19 REGULATORY MATTERS\nWe are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state and foreign agencies and undergo examinations by such regulatory\nauthorities.The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives,\nthe ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the\nlevel and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength.As of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC.The most significant changes involve the election to\nexclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions.On March 27, 2020, the regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule permitting banking organizations to delay the estimated\nimpact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL.PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1\ncapital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period.CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined\nas the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the\nallowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption.Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.At December 31, 2023 and 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S.regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.The following table sets forth the Basel III regulatory capital ratios at December

reported as of December\n31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the first quarter of 2024.Because the losses to the Deposit

a final special assessment on a one-\ntime basis if actual losses exceed the amounts collected, or cease collection early if the FDIC has collected enough to recover actual\nlosses.Based on the rule, PNC incurred expense of $515 million pre-tax, or $407 million after-tax, during the fourth quarter of 2023,\nrepresenting the total estimated cost of the assessment.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"PIwOmjVAlXow+lYdyTB6qsMh+3OnHRYQXOlPXcHVM5o="},"fd8f3492-0a0d-4782-94f5-af7c8f4a2086":{"id_":"fd8f3492-0a0d-4782-94f5-af7c8f4a2086","metadata":{"page_number":176,"total_pages":209,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

20 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when\ninformation related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of\nloss can be reasonably estimated.Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances.When we\nare able to do so, we also determine estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, whether in excess\nof any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings(“Disclosed Matters,” which are\nthose matters disclosed in this Note 20).For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of\npossible losses, as of December 31, 2023, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related\naccrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount less than $300 million.The estimates included in this amount are based on our\nanalysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties.As\nnew information is obtained we may change our estimates.Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of\noutcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us\nfrom the legal proceedings in question.Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be

As amended, the complaint alleges that PNC’s mobile remote deposit capture\nsystems infringe four patents owned by USAA. USAA seeks, among other things, a judgment that PNC is infringing each of the\npatents, damages for willful infringement, and attorneys’ fees. PNC, in its answer, alleged that USAA infringed four of PNC’s patents\nand that PNC seeks, among other things, a judgment that USAA is infringing each of the patents, damages for willful infringement,\nand attorneys’ fees.

reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology which is designed to consider\ninterest rate and liquidity risks.Under our methodology, assets receive a funding charge while liabilities and

irregular nature.We have allocated the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments based on the loan exposures within each\nbusiness segment’s portfolio.176 The PNC Financial

the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers(Topic 606).The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with\ncustomers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP.The standard requires the application of a\nfive-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in\nthe contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer.Fee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within our three reportable business segments: Retail Banking,\nCorporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management Group.Interest income, income from

commercial side\nin 2023.And our strong corporate\nrelationships, which are built\naround products and services,\nhave helped us attract and retain\ncommercial balances.However, for the vast majority\nof small- to mid-sized banks,\nattracting new depositors and\ngrowing their balance sheets has\nbecome more difficult.And this\nwill only become more challenging\nas we are likely headed into a\nregulatory environment with fewer\ntiers, which could put additional\npressure on mid-sized banks in\nterms of capital and liquidity\nrequirements.Meanwhile, the\ncosts of necessary technology and\ncybersecurity investments remain\ndisproportionately high for smaller\nbanks compared to the largest\nbanks — who are able to realize\neconomies of scale across their\nvast customer bases.The takeaway from all of this is that\nscale and density in banking matter\nhave been organically gaining deposit\nmarket share for more than a\ndecade.And last year’s bank failures\nonly accelerated that uphill migration.While PNC benefitted from that\nprocess, the biggest banks benefitted\nmore.And if our industry keeps\nmoving down its current path, we’ll\nend up with only a couple of banks\nholding

Factors in Item 1A of this Report discussing the impact of financial regulatory initiatives on the regulatory environment for us\nand the financial services industry.In addition, we are subject to comprehensive supervision and examination by many regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve\nand the OCC.These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory policies of the\nagency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the\nBoard of Directors, the effectiveness of internal controls and internal audit function, earnings, liquidity and various other factors.The results of examination activity by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant\nlimitations on our activities and growth.These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and\nlimitations on the operations of a regulated entity and take enforcement action, including the imposition of substantial monetary\npenalties and nonmonetary requirements, against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines, among

capital rules is\nthe international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee, the international body responsible for developing\nglobal regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions.The regulatory capital\nrules establish minimum requirements for the ratio of a banking organization’s regulatory capital to its risk-weighted assets, referred to\nas risk-based capital requirements, as well as for the ratio of its regulatory capital to measures of assets and other exposures, referred\nto as leverage capital requirements.The agencies’ regulatory capital rules have undergone significant change since 2013, when the\nagencies adopted final rules to implement the Basel Committee’s international regulatory capital framework, known as “Basel III”, as\nwell as certain provisions of Dodd-Frank.On July 27, 2023, and as described in more detail below, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and\nFDIC proposed for public comment an interagency rule to implement the final components of the Basel III framework that would\nsignificantly revise the capital requirements for large banking organizations, including PNC and PNC Bank.The federal banking agencies currently tailor the application of their capital, liquidity and enhanced prudential requirements for\nbanking organizations to the asset size and risk profile (as measured by certain regulatory metrics)of the banking organization.The\nagencies’ capital and liquidity rules classify all BHCs with $100 billion or more in total assets into one of four categories (Category I,\nCategory II, Category III and Category IV), with the most stringent capital and liquidity requirements applying to Category I firms and\nthe least restrictive requirements applying to Category IV firms.The classification of any bank subsidiary of a BHC generally follows\nthat of its parent

The thresholds at which an insured depository\ninstitution is considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically\nundercapitalized” are based on (i)the institution’s CET1, Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios; (ii)the institution’s leverage ratio;\nand (iii)for the definitions of “adequately capitalized” and “undercapitalized”, the institution’s supplementary leverage ratio (if\napplicable).Generally, the smaller an institution’s capital base in relation to its risk-weighted or total assets, the greater the scope and\nseverity of the agencies’ powers.Business activities may also be affected by an institution’s capital classification.For example, PNC\nand PNC Bank must remain “well capitalized” for PNC to continue to take advantage of financial holding company status as described\nbelow.At December 31, 2023, PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the required ratios for classification as “well capitalized.” For additional\ndiscussion of capital adequacy requirements, including the levels of capital required to be considered “well capitalized,” see the\nLiquidity and Capital Management

would\nbe required to recognize most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital and deduct from CET1 capital, among other items, MSRs,\ndeferred tax assets, and investments in unconsolidated financial

Change Strategy\nWe recognize that environmental issues, such as climate change, could pose significant financial, legal and reputational risk to PNC.\nWe support the transition to a low-carbon economy by striving to manage our physical footprint in a sustainable manner, incorporating\nclimate-related risk considerations into our ERM framework, integrating responsible investing strategies into our investment and\nportfolio management practices, and helping clients finance their own sustainability goals. These tenets have been incorporated into\nour Climate Action Strategy that was formalized at the start of 2022 to enable us to finance the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nOur approach will be iterative and flexible, highlighting five main areas: employee engagement; long-term collaboration with\nstakeholders, external partners and industry groups; support for our customers’ transition plans; executing on our own operational\nsustainability goals; and portfolio alignment over time, emphasizing climate risk identification and management, and financed\nemissions calculations as initial work sets.\nOur governance of climate issues seeks to ensure an appropriate balancing of environmental considerations with other organizational\npriorities as we pursue our purpose of helping all of our stakeholders move forward financially. PNC’s Board oversees climate\nchange-related efforts. Specific internal working groups, engaging with relevant stakeholders within PNC, then carry out these efforts.\nIn addition, we have an established risk management framework that helps identify, assess, monitor and report on environmental risks,\nincluding those related to climate change. PNC’s Climate Risk Committee specifically oversees the integration of climate-related risks\ninto the ERM Framework.\nWe assess climate change risks under two distinct categories: transition risks and physical risks. Transition risks are experienced as the\nworld moves toward a low-carbon economy and becomes less reliant upon fossil fuels. They can be reputational in nature or driven by\nchanges in the market, technology and/or policy. Because transition risks are typically experienced to a greater degree in the short- to\nmedium-term, they are dependent upon near-term policy decisions. Physical risks arise from risks associated with natural perils, such\nas hurricanes, fires, floods and drought.

these risks.For\nmore information about how we manage risks, see the Risk Management section of this Report.The following are the material risk factors that affect us of which we are currently aware.Any one or more of these risk factors could\nhave a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.In addition, these risks present\nother

vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions.Given the nature of our business, our business and overall financial performance are affected to a significant extent by economic\nconditions, primarily in the U.S.Declining or adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in investor, consumer and business\nsentiment generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services or reduce the\nnumber of creditworthy borrowers.The ability of borrowers to repay loans is often weakened as a result of economic downturns,\nhigher inflation and unemployment.This may be further exacerbated by a deterioration in households’ finances, particularly if\nconsumers also continue to face high inflation.In addition, adverse economic conditions, including periods of inflation, may limit the\navailability of, or increase the costs of, capital and labor, erode consumer and customer purchasing power, confidence and spending\nand may also reduce

quality of our capital and\nliquidity, impact our business activities and may prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders\nor force us to take actions contrary to their interests.For example, PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return\ncapital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with its SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal\nReserve’s CCAR process.The Federal Reserve can also impose additional limitations on capital distributions, such as the limitations\non distributions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2007-2008 financial crisis.In addition, dividends from PNC\nBank and, to a lesser extent, non-bank subsidiaries are PNC’s principal source of funds to, among other things, pay dividends on and\nmake repurchases of its capital stock.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"y7GHwNoQPu1HDL6RGjUmPNKAfiC0CFjZxYgDwUpYjis="},"c117efea-f9e0-480b-8e9a-39940c1c43b1":{"id_":"c117efea-f9e0-480b-8e9a-39940c1c43b1","metadata":{"page_number":38,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

indirectly by loans and securities and the importance\nof lending activity to our overall business.We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers\nand

payments.Commercial borrowers can be affected, for example, by poor business performance, changes in customer behavior or catastrophic\nlosses.Weakness in the economy or in financial markets typically adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding\nloans.We are exposed to increased credit risk if we fail to evaluate properly at origination the likely ability of a borrower to repay a\nloan.Properly estimating the current and potential value of any collateral pledged to support the loan also is critical to effectively\nmanaging credit risk.A failure to identify declining creditworthiness of a borrower or declining collateral value at a time when\nremedial actions could reduce our exposure also increases credit risk.Any decrease in our borrowers’ ability to repay loans likely\nwould result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans\nheld for sale.Managing credit risk effectively also relies on forecasts of future overall economic conditions, which are inherently\nimperfect.In addition to credit risk associated with our lending activities, we have credit risk arising from many other types of business\nrelationships.Routine transactions give us credit exposure to brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and\nhedge funds, other institutional clients, as well as vendors and other non-financial entities.Our credit risk may be exacerbated when the value of collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized, including\nbecause of legal

Security Program\nPNC’s approach to cyber risk management, oversight, and reporting is based on a well-structured information security program.The\nprogram is responsible for protecting information assets to achieve business objectives in a secure manner and designed to keep\ncustomers’ information and their funds safe and available.Program capabilities are built against industry guidance and a security\nframework to identify risks to sensitive information, protect that information and maintain an appropriate response and recovery\ncapability to help ensure resilience against information security incidents.PNC’s information security program is designed to ensure that PNC follows industry guidance and security frameworks for data\nprotection, system development security, identity and access management, incident management, threat and vulnerability\nmanagement, security operations management and third- and fourth-party security.Our program is continuously enhanced by threat\nintelligence, new regulations, industry guidance and disruptive new technologies.The program includes, among other things, annual\nsecurity and privacy training for all PNC employees, phishing exercises, and informative articles and communications to raise\nemployee awareness.PNC actively monitors and responds to the overall cybersecurity threat landscape via active capabilities to share information and\nleverage intelligence, monitoring, and response capabilities across the security industry, which include cybersecurity threats, physical\nthreats and fraud.PNC’s intelligence and analysis capabilities collaborate to analyze events and trends for possible response.We have not experienced any material cybersecurity threats that have impacted PNC’s business strategy, results of operations, or\nfinancial condition to date.Notwithstanding our well-established approach regarding cybersecurity, we may not be successful in\npreventing or mitigating the impact of a cybersecurity incident that could have a material impact on our business, results of operations\nor financial condition.See Item 1A Risk Factors of this Report for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.Board

our Board of Directors out of funds legally\navailable for this purpose.Our Board of Directors may not pay or set apart dividends on the common stock until dividends for all past\ndividend periods on any series of outstanding preferred stock and certain outstanding capital securities issued by the parent company\nhave been paid or declared and set apart for payment.The Board of Directors presently intends to continue the policy of paying\nquarterly cash dividends.The amount of any future dividends will depend on economic and market conditions, our financial condition\nand operating results, and other factors, including contractual restrictions and applicable government regulations and policies (such as\nthose relating to the ability of bank and non-bank subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company and regulatory capital\nlimitations).PNC’s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to PNC’s compliance with\nits SCB, which is determined at least annually through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process as described in the Supervision and\nRegulation section in Item 1 of this Report.Consistent with the SCB framework, which allows for capital return in amounts in excess\nof the SCB minimum levels, our Board of Directors has authorized a repurchase framework under the previously approved repurchase\nprogram of up to 100 million common shares, of which approximately 45% were still available for repurchase at December 31, 2023.In light of the Federal banking agencies proposed rules to adjust the Basel III capital framework,

services to institutional clients, including corporations, healthcare systems, insurance companies,\nmunicipalities and non-profits.Asset Management Group earnings decreased $70 million in 2023 compared with 2022, driven by lower net interest income and\nnoninterest income and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by provision recapture.Net interest income decreased in the comparison due to decline in average deposits as well as narrower interest rate spreads on the\nvalue of loans, partially offset by higher average loans and wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.Noninterest income decreased in the comparison driven by lower asset management fees due to the impact of client activity.Noninterest expense increased in the comparison, reflecting continued investments to support business growth.Average loans increased compared with 2022, driven by growth in residential real estate lending, partially offset by a decrease in\nsecurity based lending lines of credit.Average deposits decreased in the comparison due to competitive pricing pressures as clients continue to seek higher yielding returns,\nincluding deploying funds into discretionary client assets under management.Discretionary client assets under management increased in comparison to the prior year, primarily due to higher spot equity markets as\nof December 31, 2023, partially offset

are\nespecially critical in terms of our risk awareness, risk-taking behavior and risk management practices.Managing risk is every employee’s responsibility.All of our employees, individually and collectively, are responsible for ensuring the\norganization is performing with the utmost integrity, is applying sound risk management practices and is striving to achieve our stated\nobjectives.All employees are also responsible for understanding our Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement, the ERM Framework and\nhow risk management applies to their respective roles and responsibilities.Employees are encouraged to collaborate across groups to\nidentify and mitigate risks and elevate issues as required.We reinforce risk management responsibilities through a performance\nmanagement system where employee performance goals include risk management objectives and incentives for employees to\nreinforce balanced measures of risk-adjusted performance.Proactive and open communication, between groups and up to the Board of Directors, facilitates timely identification and resolution of\nrisk issues.Our multi-level risk committee structure provides formal channels to identify and report risk.Enterprise Strategy\nWe seek to ensure that our overall enterprise strategy is within acceptable risk parameters through our risk appetite, strategic planning,\ncapital planning and stress testing processes.These components are reviewed and approved at least annually by the Board of Directors\nor one of its committees.Risk Appetite: Our risk appetite represents the organization’s desired enterprise risk position, set within our capital-based risk and\nliquidity capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans.The Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement qualitatively\ndescribes the aggregate level of risk we are willing to accept in order to execute our business strategies.Qualitative guiding\nprinciples further define each of the risks within our

contracts.Credit risk is one of our most significant risks.Our processes for managing credit risk are designed to be\nembedded in our risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related\nexposures are identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk\nappetite and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board of\nDirectors through our governance structure.Our most significant concentration of credit risk is in our loan portfolio.Credit Risk Management is working to understand and incorporate into our credit risk management framework the impacts to credit\nrisk that may accelerate or be introduced as a result of climate change, including impacts from physical risk events and risks associated\nwith the transition to a low-carbon economy.These risk events may impact a borrower’s income, cash flow or collateral due to the\nfrequency or severity of weather events, changing market conditions, consumer preferences and demand for products, or changes to\nthe legislative and regulatory landscape.As disruptive events occur, PNC follows a process to determine if enhanced portfolio\nmonitoring, reporting and executive communication is warranted to ensure appropriate oversight and action.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"HH1yA1zQ/va/FPctn+rK6WofwD/DyuSNtx+vii2Uod0="},"7bf0e274-aa55-49e3-a3b4-99f5511db4f7":{"id_":"7bf0e274-aa55-49e3-a3b4-99f5511db4f7","metadata":{"page_number":80,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses(Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and\nVintage Disclosures, which eliminates the accounting guidance for TDRs and enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan\nmodifications when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty.Refer to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 3 Loans and Related\nAllowance for Credit Losses for additional information on our adoption of this ASU.Allowance for Credit Losses\nOur determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, current economic conditions, the reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions and other relevant factors, including current borrower and/or transaction\ncharacteristics and assessments of the remaining estimated contractual term as of the balance sheet date.We maintain the ACL at an\nappropriate level for expected losses on our existing investment securities, loans, equipment finance leases, other financial assets and\nunfunded lending related commitments.Expected losses are estimated primarily using a combination of (i)the expected losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast\nperiod, (ii)a period of reversion to long run average expected losses, where applicable and (iii)long run average expected losses for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term.We use forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses for our reasonable and supportable forecast period.For this\npurpose, we have established a framework which includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios and\nassociated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes.Forward-looking information,\nsuch as forecasted relevant macroeconomic variables, is incorporated into the expected credit loss estimates using quantitative\nmacroeconomic models, as well as through analysis from PNC’s economists and management’s judgment.The reversion period is used to bridge our three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period and the long-run average expected\ncredit losses.We consider a number of factors in determining the duration of the reversion period, such as contractual maturity of the\nasset, observed historical patterns and the estimated credit loss rates at the end of the forecast period relative to the beginning of the\nlong run average period.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"ULN8hvc/lwC9Fb98BZb8817nOHj/nx2abFtHVlY3L/I="},"c31e5ab9-e950-446e-836a-48403fbeea2f":{"id_":"c31e5ab9-e950-446e-836a-48403fbeea2f","metadata":{"page_number":86,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

of the allowances for investment securities and other financial assets.See also the Critical Accounting Estimates and\nJudgments section of this Report for further discussion of the assumptions used in the determination of the ACL as of December 31,\n2023.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nOur pooled expected credit loss methodology is based upon the quantification of PD, LGD, EAD and the remaining estimated\ncontractual term for a loan, loan segment or lease.We also consider the impact of prepayments and amortization on the estimated\ncontractual term in our expected loss estimates.We use historical data, current borrower characteristics and forecasted economic\nvariables in quantitative methods to estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease.PDs represent a quantification of\nrisk of the likelihood that a borrower may not be able to pay their contractual obligation over a defined period of time.LGD describes\nthe estimated magnitude of potential loss if a borrower were to default, and EAD (or utilization rates for certain revolving loans)is the\nestimated balance outstanding at the expected time of default.These parameters are calculated for each forecasted scenario and the\nlong-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario in proportion to the scenario weights.Prior to January 1, 2023, we used a discounted cash flow methodology for our consumer real estate related loan classes and certain\nTDRs.Effective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our use of the discounted cash flow methodology, and we now use a pooled\nexpected credit loss methodology as described above.For loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans, we establish individually assessed reserves using\nmethods prescribed by GAAP.Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans exceeding a defined dollar threshold are\nbased on an analysis of the present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate\nunder our policy for collateral dependent loans.Commercial nonperforming loans that are below the defined threshold are collectively\nreserved for, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"zvlEN/1QSJWW6+01Pzk7wAGgHVPFzvgHIhURk9mL4lU="},"e6e4f2bc-45af-4f88-82ff-484fae9ea5de":{"id_":"e6e4f2bc-45af-4f88-82ff-484fae9ea5de","metadata":{"page_number":87,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

risk has two fundamental components.The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements\nat a reasonable cost.The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not\navailable.We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company and all subsidiaries combined)to help\nensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and\nstressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.To ensure a strong liquidity\nposition and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid\nunencumbered securities.Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific,\nliquidity stress event.In addition, management performs a set of internal liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying\nlevels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential liquidity stress event.In the most severe liquidity\nstress simulation, we assume that our liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure.The\nsimulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding,\naccelerated runoff of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund committed obligations.Parent\ncompany stress coverage limits and operating liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure\nthat covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical\n30-day

credit\nspreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices.We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in\nthe following activities, among others:\n• Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,\n• Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities, securities underwriting\nand our investment portfolio, and\n• Other investments, including equity, and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors.We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk.Market Risk\nManagement provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in\nthe business to management committees and, where appropriate, the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans.Many factors,\nincluding economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the\ninterest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources.Due\nto the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only\naffect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our market risk-related risk\nmanagement policies, which are approved by management’s ALCO and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"abghMJEb0kaRGaebkxq+cleOcerUFQC3h4OgIYuA1hE="},"afef8417-96a0-491d-9fbc-08e3310fe4e2":{"id_":"afef8417-96a0-491d-9fbc-08e3310fe4e2","metadata":{"page_number":95,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

in place, reflecting $12.5 billion of caps and $12.5 billion of floors, that are used to hedge\nthese commercial loans.Additionally, PNC utilizes receive fix / pay float swaps as a means of hedging fixed rate debt.See Note 15\nFinancial Derivatives for additional information on how we use derivatives to hedge commercial loans and fixed rate debt.EVE sensitivity results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022 follow:\nTable 32: Economic Value of Equity Sensitivity Analysis\nFourth Quarter 2023 Fourth Quarter 2022\nEconomic Value of Equity Sensitivity Simulation\n200 basis point instantaneous increase (4.3)% (5.1)%\n200 basis point instantaneous decrease (3.9)% (3.1)%\nEVE measures the present value of all projected future cash flows associated with a point-in-time balance sheet and does not include\nprojected new volume.EVE sensitivity to interest rate changes is a complementary metric to NII sensitivity analysis and represents an\nestimation of long-term interest rate risk.PNC calculates its EVE sensitivity by measuring the changes in the economic value of\nassets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments in response to an instantaneous +/-200 bps parallel shift in interest rates.Similar to\nthe NII sensitivity analysis, we incorporate dynamic deposit repricing and loan prepayment assumptions.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"NMKQdWcTIHU6gdgB531tqmvXWCa6rld2XUgIP3hjn1U="},"c6538c89-b000-4b4d-9561-9fcc9084b8a2":{"id_":"c6538c89-b000-4b4d-9561-9fcc9084b8a2","metadata":{"page_number":96,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging\nactivities.These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are\nmarked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities.We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.We use VaR as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities.VaR is used to estimate\nthe probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors.A diversified VaR reflects empirical\ncorrelations across different asset classes.We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for 2023 and\n2022 were within our acceptable limits.To help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate VaR for each portfolio and enterprise-wide, we use a process known as\nbacktesting.The backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the VaR levels that were\ncalculated at the close of the prior day.Our VaR measure assumes that exposures remain constant and that recent market variability is\na good predictor of future variability.Actual observations include customer-related revenue and intraday hedging, which helps to\nreduce losses and can reduce the number of instances actual losses exceed the prior day VaR measure.There were no instances during\n2023 and 2022 under our diversified VaR measure where actual losses exceeded the prior-day VaR measure.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"YzPqO+CfUDoSgship0VeGlPrEhlLCcUa8FpgrrpEkTM="},"5aa4511f-8da7-4587-879a-8a76dd4d4799":{"id_":"5aa4511f-8da7-4587-879a-8a76dd4d4799","metadata":{"page_number":96,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

other financial assets and unfunded lending related commitments, for\nthe remaining estimated contractual term of the assets or exposures, taking into consideration expected prepayments and estimated\nrecoveries.Our determination of the ACL is based on historical loss and performance experience, as well as current borrower and\ntransaction characteristics including collateral type and quality, current economic conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of\nfuture economic conditions and other relevant factors.We use methods sensitive to changes in economic conditions to interpret these\nfactors and to estimate expected credit losses.We evaluate and, when appropriate, enhance the quality of our data and models and\nother methods used to estimate the ACL on an ongoing basis.We incorporate qualitative factors in the ACL that reflect our best\nestimate of expected losses that may not be adequately represented in our quantitative methods or economic assumptions.The major\ndrivers of ACL estimates include, but are not limited to:\n• Current economic conditions: Our forecast of expected losses depends on economic conditions as of the estimation date.As\ncurrent

1\nAccounting Policies.Reasonable and Supportable Economic Forecast\nPursuant to the CECL standard, we are required to consider reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses.For this purpose, we have established a framework that includes a three-year forecast period and the use of four economic scenarios\nwith associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic outcomes.Credit losses estimated in\nour reasonable and supportable forecast period are sensitive to the shape and severity of the scenarios used and weights assigned to\nthem.To forecast the distribution of economic outcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period, we generate four economic\nforecast scenarios using a combination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-\nlooking expert judgment.Each scenario is then given an associated probability (weight)to represent our current expectation within\nthat distribution over the forecast period.This process is informed by current economic conditions, expected business cycle evolution\nand the expert judgment of PNC’s RAC.This approach seeks to provide a reasonable representation of the forecast of expected\neconomic outcomes and is used to estimate expected credit losses across a variety of loans, securities and other financial assets.Each\nquarter, the scenarios are presented to RAC for approval, and the committee also approves CECL scenario weights for use during the\ncurrent reporting period.The scenarios used for the period ended December 31, 2023 consider, among other factors, the ongoing inflationary pressures and the\ncorresponding tightening of monetary policy and credit availability.We used a number of economic variables in our scenarios, with two of the most significant drivers being real GDP and the U.S.unemployment

a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or\non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses – Commercial Loans\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loans and lease losses was approximately\n$4,791 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $3,259 million relates to commercial loans.For commercial loans, the\ndetermination of the allowance is based on historical loss experience, current borrower risk characteristics, current economic\nconditions, reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and other relevant factors.As disclosed by management, the Company\nconsiders reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating expected credit losses and has established a framework which includes\nthe use of four economic scenarios with associated probability weights, which in combination create a forecast of expected economic\noutcomes over the reasonable and supportable forecast period.To generate the four economic forecast scenarios, the Company uses a\ncombination of quantitative macroeconomic models, other measures of economic activity and forward-looking judgment to forecast\nthe distribution of economic outcomes.Management used a number of economic variables in the scenarios, which are inputs into the\nloss forecasting models, with the most significant drivers being Real GDP and U.S.unemployment rate.Also included in the\nallowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the\nCompany’s assessment, may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions.For example,\nqualitative factors may include industry concentration and conditions, changes in market conditions, changes in the nature and volume\nof the Company’s portfolio, recent credit quality trends, recent loss experience in particular portfolios, recent macroeconomic factors,\nlimitations of available input data, model imprecision, changes in lending policies, and other factors.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for\ncommercial loans is a critical audit matter are

related, (iii)Card and cash management, (iv)Lending and deposit services, (v)Residential and commercial mortgage and (vi)Other noninterest income.Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2022, PNC

herein reflect these changes.A description of each revenue stream follows:\nAsset management and brokerage includes revenue from our asset management and retail brokerage businesses.Asset management\nservices include investment management, custody, retirement planning, family planning, trust management and retirement\nadministration.Brokerage services offer retail customers a wide range of investment options, including mutual funds, annuities, stock,\nbonds and managed accounts.Capital markets and advisory includes revenue from services and activities primarily related to merger and acquisition advisory,\nequity capital markets advisory, asset-backed financing, loan syndication, securities underwriting, credit valuation adjustments related\nto the derivatives portfolio

of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.Use of Estimates\nWe prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us\nto make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.Our most significant estimates pertain to the ACL and our fair\nvalue measurements.Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial\nstatements.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and due from banks are considered cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes because they represent a primary\nsource of liquidity.Certain cash balances within Cash and due from banks on our Consolidated Balance Sheet are restricted as to\nwithdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements.Investments\nWe hold interests in various types of investments.The accounting for these investments is dependent on a number of factors including,\nbut not limited to, items such as:\n• Ownership interest,\n• Our plans for the investment, and\n• The nature of the investment.Debt Securities\nDebt securities are recorded on a trade-date basis.We classify debt securities as either trading, held to maturity or available for sale.Debt securities that we purchase for certain risk management activities or customer-related trading activities are classified as trading\nsecurities, are reported in the Other assets line item on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are carried at fair value.For

the estimated contractual term in our expected loss estimates.We use historical credit loss information, current borrower risk\ncharacteristics and forecasted economic variables for the reasonable and supportable forecast period, coupled with analytical methods,\nto estimate these risk parameters by loan, loan segment or lease.PD, LGD and EAD parameters are calculated for each forecasted\nscenario and the long-run average period, and are combined to generate expected loss estimates by scenario.Each scenario is then\nweighted to determine our total estimated loss.The following matrix provides key credit risk characteristics that we use to estimate\nthese risk parameters.Loan Class Probability of Default Loss Given Default Exposure at Default\nCommercial\nCommercial and\nindustrial

methodology for our home equity and residential real estate loan classes, in\naddition to our TDR portfolios.We determined effective interest rates considering contractual cash flows adjusted for estimated\nprepayments.Changes in the ALLL due to the impact of the passage of time under the discounted cash flow estimate were recognized\nthrough the provision for credit losses.Effective January 1, 2023, we discontinued our use of a discounted cash flow methodology, and we now use a pooled expected loss\nmethodology based upon the quantification of risk parameters, such as PD, LGD and EAD for a loan or loan segment.Individually Assessed Component\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans are individually assessed as follows:\n• For commercial nonperforming loans greater than or equal to a defined dollar threshold, reserves are based on an analysis of\nthe present value of the loan’s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral, if appropriate under our policy for\ncollateral dependent loans.Nonperforming commercial loans below the defined threshold are reserved for under a pooled\nbasis, as we believe these loans continue to share similar risk characteristics.• For consumer nonperforming loans classified as collateral dependent, charge-off and ALLL related to recovery of amounts\npreviously charged off are evaluated through an analysis of the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.Qualitative Component\nWhile our reserve models and methodologies strive to reflect all relevant expected credit risk factors, the ACL also accounts for\nfactors that may not be directly measured in the determination of individually assessed or pooled reserves.Such qualitative factors\nmay include, but are not limited to:\n• Industry concentrations and conditions,\n• Changes in market conditions, including regulatory and legal requirements,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form 10-K

asset and liability method.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws\nthat we expect will apply at the time when we believe the differences will reverse.Changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for\nin the period of enactment.Thus, at the enactment date, deferred taxes are remeasured and the change is recognized in Income tax\nexpense.The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment to determine the realization of such assets.Realization refers to\nthe incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or refunds receivable from the deferred tax assets,\nassuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future\ntaxable income.We establish a valuation allowance for tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized, based\nupon all available positive and negative evidence.We have elected to apply the proportional amortization method to our qualifying LIHTC and NMTC equity investments.Investment\ntax credits and investment impairment are recognized in tax expense for any individual LIHTC and NMTC equity investment for\nwhich we can demonstrate that the investment was

originate interest-only loans to commercial borrowers. Such credit arrangements are usually designed to match borrower cash flow\nexpectations (e.g. working capital lines, revolvers). These products are standard in the financial services industry and product features\nare considered during the underwriting process to mitigate the increased risk that the interest-only feature may result in borrowers not\nbeing able to make interest and principal payments when due. We do not believe that these product features create a concentration of\ncredit risk.\nAt December 31, 2023, we pledged $51.3 billion of commercial and other loans to the Federal Reserve Bank and $89.5 billion of\nresidential real estate and other loans to the FHLB as collateral for the ability to borrow, if necessary.

residential real estate and home equity loans at\nleast quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk\nin the loan classes.\nLTV (inclusive of CLTV for first and subordinate lien positions): At least quarterly, we update the property values of real estate\ncollateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant\ndeclines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to\nmonitor the risk in the loan classes.\nWe use a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (e.g., line management,\nloss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data\nlimitations, it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (i.e., if an updated LTV is not\nprovided by the third-party service provider, HPI changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).\nUpdated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a\ncombination of third-party automated valuation models, broker price opinions, HPI indices, property location, internal and external\nbalance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-\nparty, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of\nthe calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as\nsuch, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we refine our methodology.\n118 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form

continuing\ninvolvement.These transfers have occurred through Agency securitization, Non-agency securitization, and loan sale transactions.Agency securitizations consist of securitization transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA (collectively, the Agencies).FNMA\nand FHLMC generally securitize our transferred loans into mortgage-backed securities for sale into the secondary market through\nSPEs that they sponsor.As an authorized GNMA issuer/servicer, we pool FHA and Department of VA insured loans into mortgage-\nbacked securities for sale into the secondary market.In Non-agency securitizations, we have transferred loans into securitization SPEs.In other instances, third-party investors have also purchased our loans in loan sale transactions and in certain instances have\nsubsequently sold these loans into securitization SPEs.Securitization SPEs utilized in the Agency and Non-agency securitization\ntransactions are VIEs.Our continuing involvement in the FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA securitizations, Non-agency securitizations, and loan sale\ntransactions generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans or loss share arrangements under certain\nconditions, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization SPEs.Depending on the transaction, we may act as the master, primary and/or special servicer to the securitization SPEs or

and\nDecember 31, 2022 are shown in Tables 57 and 58.The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors\ndriving the fair value.Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial\nmortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments.These models have\nbeen refined based on current market conditions and management judgment.Future interest rates are another important factor in the\nvaluation of MSRs.Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and\ndiscount rates.The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S.dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent\nwith pricing of capital markets instruments.Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in\nvolatility in the fair value estimate.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"pv8zgFUadWzXj9MCogfJOwYF54+hrQADAqTDbRTnS1Q="},"f197a852-85a1-4bcf-a8a1-af7904976dbe":{"id_":"f197a852-85a1-4bcf-a8a1-af7904976dbe","metadata":{"page_number":150,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

significance of the unobservable\ninput, we classified this portfolio as Level 3.Securities Available for Sale and Trading Securities\nSecurities accounted for at fair value include both the available for sale and trading portfolios.We primarily use prices obtained from\npricing services, dealer quotes or recent trades to determine the fair value of securities.The majority of securities were priced by third-\nparty vendors.The third-party vendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive\nat an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions.We monitor and validate\nthe reliability of vendor pricing on an ongoing basis through pricing methodology reviews, including detailed reviews of the\nassumptions and inputs used by the vendor to price individual securities, and through price validation testing.Securities not priced by\none of our pricing vendors may be valued using a dealer quote, which are also subject to price validation testing.Price validation\ntesting is performed independent of the risk-taking function and involves corroborating the prices received from third-party

15 FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES\nWe use a variety of financial derivatives to both mitigate exposure to market (primarily interest rate)and credit risks inherent in our\nbusiness activities, as well as to facilitate customer risk management activities.We manage these risks as part of our overall asset and\nliability management process and through our credit policies and procedures.Derivatives represent contracts between parties that\nusually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based\non a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.Derivative transactions are often measured in terms of notional amount, but this amount is generally not exchanged and it is not\nrecorded on the balance sheet.The notional amount is the basis to which the underlying is applied to determine required payments\nunder the derivative contract.The underlying is a referenced interest rate, security price, credit spread or other index.Residential and\ncommercial real estate loan commitments associated with loans to be sold also qualify as derivative instruments.The following tables presents the notional and gross fair value amounts of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us.Table 85: Total Gross Derivatives (a)December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nIn millions Notional /\nContract Amount Asset

enforceable master netting agreements.The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the\ncloseout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the\noccurrence of an event of default.The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to\ncollateralize either party’s net position.Collateral is typically exchanged daily on unsettled positions based on the net fair value of the\npositions with the counterparty as of the preceding day.Collateral representing initial margin, which is based on potential future\nexposure, may also be required to be exchanged.In certain cases, minimum thresholds must be exceeded before any collateral is\nexchanged.Any cash collateral exchanged with counterparties under these master netting agreements is also netted, when appropriate,\nagainst the applicable derivative fair values on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"e/Ac/wTeXzP31vG3/19jVdifaHBP1ekEu6/rxsIJfoU="},"6e6a4cea-29f1-4b23-8a57-8180ed268ee0":{"id_":"6e6a4cea-29f1-4b23-8a57-8180ed268ee0","metadata":{"page_number":178,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC

at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements.The table also includes the fair value of any securities

represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that\nare not settled through an organized exchange or directly cleared through a central clearing house.The majority of OTC

pension plan (the Plan)is to:\n• Meet present and future benefit obligations to all participants and beneficiaries,\n• Cover reasonable expenses incurred to provide such benefits, including expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust\nand the Plan,\n• Provide sufficient liquidity to meet benefit and expense payment requirements on a timely basis, and\n• Provide a total return that, over the long term, maximizes the ratio of trust assets to liabilities by maximizing investment\nreturn, at an appropriate level of risk.The Plan’s named investment fiduciary has the ability to make short to intermediate term asset allocation shifts under the dynamic\nasset allocation strategy based on factors such as the Plan’s funded status, the named investment fiduciary’s view of return on equities\nrelative to long term expectations, the named investment fiduciary’s view on the direction of interest rates and credit spreads, and\nother relevant financial or economic factors which would be expected to impact the ability of the Trust to meet its obligation to\nparticipants and beneficiaries.Accordingly, the allowable asset allocation ranges have been updated to incorporate the flexibility\nrequired by the dynamic allocation policy.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – 2023 Form 10-K

19 REGULATORY MATTERS\nWe are subject to the regulations of certain federal, state and foreign agencies and undergo examinations by such regulatory\nauthorities.The ability to undertake new business initiatives (including acquisitions), the access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives,\nthe ability to pay dividends, the ability to repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the\nlevel and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength.As of January 1, 2020, the 2019 Tailoring Rules became effective for PNC.The most significant changes involve the election to\nexclude specific AOCI items from CET1 capital and higher thresholds used to calculate CET1 capital deductions.On March 27, 2020, the regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule permitting banking organizations to delay the estimated\nimpact on regulatory capital stemming from implementing CECL.PNC elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on CET1\ncapital through December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period.CECL’s estimated impact on CET1 capital is defined\nas the change in retained earnings at adoption plus or minus 25% of the change in CECL ACL at the balance sheet date, excluding the\nallowance for PCD loans, compared to CECL ACL at adoption.Effective for the first quarter of 2022, PNC is now in the three-year\ntransition period, and the full impact of the CECL standard is being phased-in to regulatory capital through December 31, 2024.At December 31, 2023 and 2022, PNC and PNC Bank were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S.regulatory\ncapital ratio requirements.The following table sets forth the Basel III regulatory capital ratios at December

determination\nannounced in March 2023, to recover the cost associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of Silicon Valley\nBank and Signature Bank.Under the rule, the FDIC will collect from PNC, along with other BHCs and insured depository institutions,\nspecial assessments at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points of an institution’s uninsured deposits reported as of December\n31, 2022 (adjusted to exclude the first $5 billion), over eight quarterly assessment periods, beginning after the first quarter of 2024.Because the losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund from the systemic risk exception are estimated, the FDIC will periodically adjust the\nestimate, which could result in extending the special assessment for additional quarters, imposing a final special assessment on a one-\ntime basis if actual losses exceed the amounts collected, or cease collection early if the FDIC has collected enough to recover actual\nlosses.Based on the rule,

In June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed\n(under the caption Ohio v. American Express Co.) the court of appeal’s decision. Previously, the plaintiffs in this litigation had alleged\na one-sided market, and, as a result of the court’s decision in American Express, they sought leave to add claims based on a two-sided\nmarket. The order allowed the complaint to be amended to include allegations pertaining to a two-sided market only to the extent those\nclaims are not time-barred, but held that the two-sided market allegations do not relate back to the time of the original complaint and\nare not subject to tolling.

business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology which is designed to consider\ninterest rate and liquidity risks.Under our methodology, assets receive a funding charge while liabilities and capital receive a funding\ncredit based on market interest rates, product characteristics, and other factors.Our transfer pricing framework considers the application of funding curves and methodologies consistently across the balance sheet.A\nresidual gain or loss from funds transfer pricing operations is retained within Other.This residual gain or loss is reviewed by\nmanagement quarterly, in accordance with interagency guidance.Segment Allocations\nFinancial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a standalone basis, and includes expense\nallocations for corporate overhead services used by the business segments.Certain costs are retained within Other.These costs are not allocated to our business segments because they (i)are transitory or highly\nirregular in nature, (ii)exist solely to support corporate activities unrelated to business segment operations, or (iii)reflect residual\ncosts for an exited business.During 2023, Noninterest expense for the Other category included both the FDIC special assessment and\nworkforce reduction charges.These amounts were not allocated to our business segments due to their irregular nature.We have allocated the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending related commitments based on the loan exposures within each\nbusiness segment’s portfolio.176 The PNC

fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts\nwith Customers(Topic 606).The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with\ncustomers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP.The standard requires the application of a\nfive-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in\nthe contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer.Fee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within our three reportable business segments: Retail Banking,\nCorporate & Institutional Banking and Asset Management Group.Interest income, income from lease contracts, fair value gains from\nfinancial instruments (including derivatives), income from mortgage servicing rights and guarantee products, letter of credit fees, non-\nrefundable fees associated with acquiring or originating a loan and gains from the sale of financial assets are outside of the scope of\nTopic 606.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. –

the\ndesired risk appetite.The determination of the risk profile’s position is based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of reported risk\nlimits, metrics, operating guidelines and qualitative assessments.Risk-weighted assets – Computed by the assignment of specific risk-weights (as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System)to assets and off-balance sheet instruments.Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)– SOFR is a reference rate that is based on overnight transactions in the U.S.Treasury\nrepurchase market.Servicing rights – Intangible assets or liabilities created by an obligation to service assets for others.Typical servicing rights include\nthe right to receive a fee for collecting and forwarding payments on loans and related taxes and insurance premiums held in escrow.Supplementary leverage exposure – The sum of adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including undrawn\ncredit commitments and derivative potential future exposures.Supplementary leverage ratio – Basel III Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure.Taxable-equivalent interest income – The interest income earned on certain assets that is completely or partially exempt from federal\nincome tax.These tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments.Troubled debt restructuring (TDR)– A loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulties.On January 1, 2023, we adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated the accounting guidance for\nTDRs.","textTemplate":"","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT","hash":"XAprwculqX3BtkEBPr7ZtUHL0W+BA12zVvgm5gaz+jM="},"ca3149bf-a030-472a-9e2e-f148706d02c5":{"id_":"ca3149bf-a030-472a-9e2e-f148706d02c5","metadata":{"page_number":209,"total_pages":225,"file_path":"C:\\Users\\kevin\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\vscode\\LLM\\rag-ui\\rag\\data\\PNC
